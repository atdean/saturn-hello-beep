--- Saturn Sound System Startup Procedure (regardless of driver used) ---

1. Halt the 68000 by executing the SOUND OFF command through the SMPC.
   This will hold the (active-low) reset line HIGH.
2. From the main system SH-2, initialize the SCSP registers for a 4Mbit sound
   DRAM configuration, and a 16-bit DAC (by disabling the 18-bit DAC flag.)
   Write $02 to the SH-2 address $25B00400 (which the SCU translates to the
   sound system address of $100400, the first byte of the CSR of the SCSP.)
3. Zero-clear the 68K program area in sound RAM ($00000 to $0B000).
   This translates into $25A00000 to $25A0AFFF on the main system SH-2 side.
     - Clearing all 4Mbit of sound RAM should take 100ms or less.
4. Transfer the sound driver binary to sound RAM at $00000 ($25A00000).
5. Transfer other needed sound data (driver-dependent) to sound RAM.
6. Clear the 68000 RESET through the SMPC's SOUND ON command to start the CPU.
7. From there, communicate with the driver via its established interface(s).

--- Important processes to follow driver-side ---

1. When changing sound data in sound RAM, ensure that you clear the DSP and
   halt all currently-playing sounds, or the system could crash or behave
   unpredictably. Whether this applies to custom drivers is yet to be confirmed.
2. Do not use the RESET or TAS instructions on the 68000. Always perform resets
   of the 68k/SCSP through the SH2->SMPC only (SNDON and SNDOFF commands.)
3. Do not stop the 68k for longer than absolutely necessary and only do so when
   loading the driver into sound RAM, or the system may crash.
     - Always start the 68k immediately (within 0.5s) after loading the driver.
     - Do not stop the 68k even if it has nothing to process; instead run an
       idle loop or something similar.
4. The main system SH-2 gets priority over the 68k in accessing sound RAM via SCU.
   TODO :: Notes on DMA and bus access priority / 68k stall

--- SH-2 to SCSP interface ---

1.  To start the main CPU interface on the SCSP, the SH-2 (through SCU) sends a 1
    to the SCSP MCCSN (select signal) register. When this goes HIGH, the interface
    starts. Setting MCCSN to 0 (LOW) ends the connection.
      - The main SH-2 CPU can't write in bytes, so send 16 bit units.
2.  When the SCSP gets a read/write request from the SH-2, the SCSP sets the
    MCRDYN (ready signal) register to 1 while it fetches the data to be output
    on MCD[7:0]. The SH-2 waits until MCRDYN is set to 0, confirming the operation
    has completed.
      - Due to this stall, avoid constant R/W from the main CPU (except when the
        system is powering up and initializing the program, for example.)
      - This wait also will/should cause a stall on the 68k program.
      - During this wait/fetch period, the existing data presented on the MCD
        register does not change.

--- Things to be mindful of when changing sound RAM data ---

1. If rewriting the DSP program, DSP operation becomes unstable and
   sound will not be output properly from “EFREG”. Set “EFSDL” to “0H”
   to prevent sound from being output during the rewrite transfer.
